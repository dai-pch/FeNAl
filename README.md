# FeNAl
Flags about excited numerical algorithm.

# Contents now
- Multiprecision class for unsigned integer : UInteger.
- Multiprecision class for signed integer : Integer.
- Multiprecision class for floating point number : Real.
- Basic algorithm : fast power of integer(signed and unsigned).
- Basic algorithm : adaptive simpson integration method for any function.
- Class for polynomial and numerical method to find all the root.
- Tests for these method above.
- Remainder-theorem implementation.

# Build
- Make a new directories "build" in the FeNAl folder and enter.
- Run command "cmake ..".
- Run command "make & make test" if you are in Linux;
- Build project using VS if you are in Windows.

# ToDo:
- Add tests for Remainder-theorem.
- Optimize the performance. Make it faster.
- and so on.
